What we have learn
This week our team talk about our topic and we have made a decision to use which way to represent our project. We decided that each of us do a part of our project. Tao will do the part of “Eat”, Xiaoke and I research the OTN database deeply and find the relationship of different season and different kinds of fish in different level in the sea. Each of us should find 3 kinds of fishes and then we should give these data to NASCAD guys (Tao Zhang and Rui Zhou). They will design the pictures and show them in our project. The other two guys (Patricia and Kyle) will find the evaluation Methods and Criteria. Then we will get the information about what the travelers really want to know and what they want to get in our “Cruise Ship” project. We have our github milestone and each of us have know what we should do next.  

What we should do next
Next week we will get the information together and make a decision how these information use in our project. And distribute job of next week.
